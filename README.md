# MiniSkidi Bluepad32
This repository is a fork of the awesome https://github.com/ProfBoots/MiniSkidi-V3.0 which allows you to control the Skidi via gamepads. 
To paraphrase ProfBoots - "Truth be told, controlling Skidi via Webserver be cumbersome!". 
It uses Bluepad32, just watch the this guide to get setup using the arduino IDE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnY-XXiD8Q

According to the documentation, you can use just about any controller, but I have only tested it with a PS4 controller. 
For further documentation, check out Bluepad32 as well: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32 


## Keymap
- Skidi drives with the left joystick
- Bucket and claw are controlled with the right joystick
- Arm is controlled with L1/R1
- Lights are on-off with the `options` key

## Pairing
To pair the PS3 controller, hold down share button before pressing the PS button until it flashes
